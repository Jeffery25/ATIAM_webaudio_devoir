# Devoir Webaudio ATIAM 2020-2021

This project was done in the context of the web audio class at ATIAM 2020-2021.

It is a webpage that uses the Tone.js library to allow the user to generate the beat phenomenon. by adding two sine waves of nearby frequency. It shows a graph of the sound wave and permits the real-time change of four parameters:
* overall volume of the sound output
* overall frequency of the sine waves
* frequency difference between the two sound waves
* panning of the two sine waves, from "both in the middle" to "hard left one, hard right the other"
